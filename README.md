# Deforestation-Classification
In this project we attempt to create an image classification model, which from a given dataset, predicts what type of deforestation appears in the image with the objective of early detection of this type of actions in protected lands.

Training for this model has been done with src/main.py

Please access this link for further information in model performance.
